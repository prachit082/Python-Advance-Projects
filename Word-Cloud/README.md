# Word Cloud From A Pandas DataFrame

A word cloud is a data visualization technique that shows the most used words in large font and the least used words in small font. It helps to get an idea about your text data, especially when working on problems based on natural language processing.

A pandas DataFrame is used to store the data that you use when working on a data science task. Sometimes your dataset contains a column with textual information such as opinions or reviews of people about a product. To understand how most people think about the product, you can visualize a word cloud of that column.

So to view a word cloud from a pandas DataFrame in Python, you need to have the `wordcloud` library installed in your Python environment. You can install this Python library using the `pip` command as mentioned below:
```bash
ppip install wordcloud
```
