# Python GUI App For Calendar

Python provides Tkinter to develop GUI applications. Now, itâ€™s up to the skills and imagination of the developer, what he want to develop using Tkinter. I've made a Python Calendar GUI application using Tkinter. In this application, User will have to fill the desired year, and the calendar for that specific year will appear through this application.
